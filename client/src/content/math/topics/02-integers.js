    <h3>1. The Number System</h3>
    <p>Numbers are classified into sets that nest inside each other:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <strong>Natural numbers (ℕ):</strong> 1, 2, 3, 4, … (counting numbers)<br>
      <strong>Whole numbers:</strong> 0, 1, 2, 3, … (includes zero)<br>
      <strong>Integers (ℤ):</strong> …, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, … (positive &amp; negative whole numbers)<br>
      <strong>Rational numbers (ℚ):</strong> any number that can be written as p/q where p, q are integers, q ≠ 0<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;e.g. ¾, −2, 0.5, 0.3̄<br>
      <strong>Irrational numbers:</strong> cannot be expressed as p/q — e.g. √2, π, √3<br>
      <strong>Real numbers (ℝ):</strong> all rational + irrational numbers
    </div>

  <div class="notes-card">
    <h3>2. Adding &amp; Subtracting Integers</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <strong>Same signs → add, keep sign:</strong><br>
      (+3) + (+4) = +7 &nbsp;&nbsp; (−3) + (−4) = −7<br><br>
      <strong>Different signs → subtract, keep sign of larger:</strong><br>
      (+7) + (−3) = +4 &nbsp;&nbsp; (−7) + (+3) = −4<br><br>
      <strong>Subtracting negatives:</strong><br>
      5 − (−3) = 5 + 3 = 8 &nbsp;&nbsp; −2 − (−6) = −2 + 6 = 4
    </div>

  <div class="notes-card">
    <h3>3. Multiplying &amp; Dividing Integers</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <strong>Signs rule:</strong><br>
      (+) × (+) = + &nbsp;&nbsp; (−) × (−) = + &nbsp;&nbsp; (+) × (−) = − &nbsp;&nbsp; (−) × (+) = −<br><br>
      (+) ÷ (+) = + &nbsp;&nbsp; (−) ÷ (−) = + &nbsp;&nbsp; (+) ÷ (−) = − &nbsp;&nbsp; (−) ÷ (+) = −<br><br>
