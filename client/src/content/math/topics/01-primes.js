  <div class="notes-card">
    <h3>1. Prime Numbers</h3>
    <p>A <strong>prime number</strong> has exactly two factors: 1 and itself. 1 is <em>not</em> prime.</p>
    <div class="example">
      Primes up to 30: <span class="highlight">2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29</span><br><br>
      <strong>Composite number:</strong> has more than two factors (e.g. 12 = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 6 × 12)<br>
      <strong>Note:</strong> 2 is the only even prime number.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="notes-card">
    <h3>2. Prime Factorisation</h3>
    <p>Write a number as a product of prime factors using a <strong>factor tree</strong> or <strong>repeated division</strong>.</p>
    <div class="example">
      Find prime factors of 60:<br>
      60 ÷ 2 = 30 &rarr; 30 ÷ 2 = 15 &rarr; 15 ÷ 3 = 5 &rarr; 5 is prime<br>
      60 = 2 &times; 2 &times; 3 &times; 5 = <span class="highlight">2² &times; 3 &times; 5</span><br><br>
      Always write in <strong>index notation</strong> from smallest prime to largest.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="notes-card">
    <h3>3. Square Roots &amp; Cube Roots</h3>
    <p>Use prime factorisation to find exact roots.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <strong>Square root:</strong> halve each index<br>
      √144 = √(2⁴ × 3²) = 2² × 3 = <span class="highlight">12</span><br><br>
      <strong>Cube root:</strong> divide each index by 3<br>
      ∛216 = ∛(2³ × 3³) = 2 × 3 = <span class="highlight">6</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="notes-card">
    <h3>4. HCF — Highest Common Factor</h3>
    <p>The <strong>HCF</strong> is the largest number that divides into all the given numbers exactly.</p>
    <div class="example">
      Find HCF(36, 60):<br>
      36 = 2² × 3²<br>
      60 = 2² × 3 × 5<br>
      HCF = 2² × 3 = <span class="highlight">12</span><br><br>
      <strong>Rule:</strong> Take each common prime factor to its <em>lowest</em> power.

  <div class="notes-card">
    <h3>5. LCM — Lowest Common Multiple</h3>
    <p>The <strong>LCM</strong> is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the given numbers.</p>

      Find LCM(12, 18):<br>
      12 = 2² × 3<br>
